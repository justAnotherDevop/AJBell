# Tasks

1. Update the project to pass the selected market object from the MarketListFragment to the MarketDetailScreen (Compose).
2. Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture in the MarketDetailScreen.
3. Populate the following fields in the MarketDetailScreen from the selected market object using the Text component:
      Epic
      Current Price
      Current Change
      Current Change Percentage
4. Use proper state composables to display the MarketDetailScreen effectively. (Des. consider also screen rotation)
5. Ensure that any business logic in the ViewModel is covered by unit tests.
6. After completing the first task, what would you choose to do next? In this task we would like to see which would be your next priority and why. (Des, DI)
7. If you had more time what would you improve?
8. What would you do differently if you were to start from scratch?
